    <string name="txtViewDescription">Loop Coding Center (LCC) is committed to find new and innovative
        ways to support students and to strengthen the impact of youth in technology through
        educational workshops and classes in our community. The Reason LCC exist is to solve the
        problem of lack of knowledge in computer coding and unprepared for the increase in job
        demand in every industry. We encourage parents who have kids from ages 11 - 18 enroll
        their kids in to this program to prepare them for the future. </string>
